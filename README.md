SmartRead is a personalised news recommendation system which recommends articles to the users fetched from an API (NewsAPI), and stored in a database (MySQL Workbench).
Content based filtering is used to recommend articles effectively by prioritizing the categories of the articles the user has read and liked.

To successfully run this project,
1. Download the project and open in an IDE (IntelliJ recommended).
2. Connect the database by adding the url, username and the password of your MySQL database.
3. An active internet connection is required to click on and read articles.
4. Follow these steps and you will be able to successfully run my javaFX application.
